# Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression
This project aims to detect fraudulent activities using logistic regression model.


#Methodology
  *Data Preprocessing:* We performed data cleaning and preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
  *Model Training:* Logistic regression was chosen as our primary model due to its simplicity and interpretability. We trained the model on the preprocessed dataset.
  *Model Evaluation:* We evaluated the model's performance using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision and recall, . 
  
Deployment: The trained model can be deployed in real-time systems or batch processing pipelines to classify transactions in production environments.
